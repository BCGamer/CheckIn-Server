I am the parent or legal guardian of the minor child listed below. I hereby execute and enter into the Hold Harmless and Assumption of Risk Agreement on his or her behalf. I understand and agree that through participation in events held in connection with the GottaCon LAN, including, without limitation, official tournaments, the event participants will likely play or be involved with M-Rated, or Mature-Rated, computer software games (with the M-Rating designating an industry rating of suggested play for individuals 17 years or older). I also acknowledge and agree that I have seen the game play involved with these games. Further, I understand that many individually owned computers brought to the GottaCon LAN may display and/or contain content deemed not suitable for minors and that participants of the GottaCon LAN can engage in informal competitions that may contain M-Rated games and/or other potentially objectionable material. I hereby provide my informed consent to my child’s (or ward’s) participation in such games at the GottaCon LAN (including participation in games prior to, or following, the GottaCon LAN), and to otherwise participate in the GottaCon LAN.
